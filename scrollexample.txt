CSS INTRODUCTION:
*CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
*CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
*saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
*External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

CSS SYNTAX:
A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.
The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.

CSS SELECTORS:
A CSS selector selects the HTML element(s) you want to style.
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.
We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
*Simple selectors :(select elements based on name, id, class)
*Combinator selectors :(select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
*Pseudo-class selectors: (select elements based on a certain state)
*Pseudo-elements selectors :(select and style a part of an element)
*Attribute selectors: (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)

CSS element Selector:
The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.

CSS id Selector:
The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!
To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.

CSS class Selector:
The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.
To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.

CSS Universal Selector:
The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.

CSS Grouping Selector:
The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.

THREE WAYS TO INSERT CSS:
There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:
1.External CSS
2.Internal CSS
3.Inline CSS

External CSS:
With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the link element, inside the head section.
An external style sheet can be written in any text editor, and must be saved with a .css extension.
The external .css file should not contain any HTML tags.
Internal CSS:
An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.
The internal style is defined inside the stylr element, inside the head section.

Inline CSS:
An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.
To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.

Multiple Style Sheets:
If some properties have been defined for the same selector (element) in different style sheets, the value from the last read style sheet will be used.
