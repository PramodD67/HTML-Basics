<p>A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.
The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.</P>
<p>A CSS selector selects the HTML element(s) you want to style.
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.
We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:</p>
<P>PSEUDO CLASS:</P>
A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.
For example, it can be used to:
<P>*Style an element when a user mouses over it</P>
<P>*Style visited and unvisited links differently</P>
<P>*Style an element when it gets focus</P>
<P>Syntax:</P>
<P>The syntax of pseudo-classes:</P>
<P>selector:pseudo-class {</P>
<P>property: value;</P>
<P>}</P>
<P>PSEUDO ELEMENT:</P>
<P>A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.
For example, it can be used to:</P>
<P>*Style the first letter, or line, of an element</P>
<P>*content before, or after, the content of an element</P>
<P>Syntax:</P>
<P>The syntax of pseudo-elements:</P>
<P>selector::pseudo-element {</P>
<P>property: value;</P>
